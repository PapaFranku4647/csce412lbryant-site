# ChemTree

## Introduction

Visit the site here: https://papafranku4647.github.io/ChemTree/

This project is a web-based representation of the Periodic Table of Elements. The site is interactive, including animations, drawings, and nice colors. Each element of the table is clickable, showing a link to its Wikipedia page at the top of the site. After clicking, at the bottom of the table there is even more information, including an animated model of the element's atom.

## Features

- **Interactive Periodic Table**: The site hosts a full layout of the Periodic Table that supports clickable elements.
- **Element Details**: Clicking an element reveals additional information about the element in the form of a short paragraph.
- **Responsive Design**: The site's layout is fully responsive but is only compatible in desktop view.
- **Animated Bohr Model**: Each element can be clicked to reveal it's model, under the Table and next to the facts paragraph.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

## Future Plan

This project is far from over, and more features are on the way. I plan to add a treelike design that shows a compound of the user's choice and shows a linked graphic diagram of its precursors, looking like a family tree for chemistry. All ideas are welcome; please feel free to add to the [Ideas Megathread](https://github.com/PapaFranku4647/ChemTree/discussions/2).
